## Repository Strategy

Mono-Repo approach

## Branching Strategy

Feature Branching

## Deployment Model

Linode shared CPU 2GB cluster

## Component Repositories

Since we are using a Mono-Repo approach, all components will reside in this repository.

## Project Boards

We will use GitHub Projects for managing tasks and issues. [https://github.com/users/sharanggupta/projects/1]

## Tickets

Create tickets in the Project Board for the User Stories. Examples:

*   Search Flights
*   Search Hotels
*   Plan Trip
*   Book Flights
*   Book Hotels
*   View Trip
*   Cancel Trip

## Use Cases

üé≠ Actors

**Primary Actors:**

*   Traveler ‚Äì interacts with the system to plan, book, and manage trips.

**Secondary Actors:**

*   External APIs ‚Äì includes Kiwi.com, TripAdvisor, OpenWeatherMap, Foursquare Places.
*   System Clock ‚Äì used for time-sensitive operations like scheduling and validation.

‚úÖ Detailed Use Case Narratives

        *   System sends query to Kiwi.com API.
        *   Displays matching flights.
    *   Alternative Flows:
        *   No flights returned ‚Üí show "No results" message.
        *   API failure ‚Üí show error and retry option.
