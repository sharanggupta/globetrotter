## Repository Strategy

Mono-Repo approach

## Branching Strategy

Feature Branching

## Deployment Model

Linode shared CPU 2GB cluster

## Component Repositories

Since we are using a Mono-Repo approach, all components will reside in this repository.

## Project Boards

We will use GitHub Projects for managing tasks and issues. [https://github.com/users/sharanggupta/projects/1]

## Tickets

Create tickets in the Project Board for the User Stories. Examples:

*   Search Flights
*   Search Hotels
*   Plan Trip
*   Book Flights
*   Book Hotels
*   View Trip
*   Cancel Trip

## Environments

*   UAT Environment
*   Production Environment

## Automated CI/CD Pipeline

We will set up an automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to build, test, and deploy the application to the UAT and Production environments.

## Developer Setup

1.  Install Docker and Docker Compose.
2.  Configure the application using Docker Compose.
